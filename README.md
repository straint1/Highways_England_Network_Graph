# Highways England Network Graph

A network graph of the Strategic Road Netowork (SRN) that is maintained by Highways England (now National Highways). 
The network is built with the published HATRIS link dataset (see our paper for full details) and models two highways (edges, i.e, one for each direction of travel) between each junction (nodes). 
It is assumed that a central crash barrier is always in place and therefore a pair of edges only ever meet at a node.

The network graph is free to use, however I ask that any further publications that use our graph cite the paper where it was published: [Patrol Regimes for Traffic Officers in Transportation Asset Monitoring](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/03611981221103243#:~:text=Within%20the%20simulation%2C%20TOs%20patrolled,across%20the%20entire%20highway%20network)
